# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added React.js to HTML code. I also created my first react app.

**Thoughts:** I really found it difficult to keep some commands in my head but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 2: September 5, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Started learning features in ECMAScript 6. Completed **Classes** and **Arrow Functions**

**Thoughts:** I had fun with the arrow functions. Easy to use and understand. The Contructors in Classes are stuck in my head. I am hopeful today.
